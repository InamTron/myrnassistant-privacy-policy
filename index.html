<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy – My RN Assistant</strong><br />
Last updated: January 2026</p>

<p>
My RN Assistant (“the App”) is an educational and clinical documentation support application
designed for nursing students and individual registered nurses. This Privacy Policy explains
what information is collected, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
<p>
The App allows users to enter assessment data, notes, and clinical documentation for their own
educational or professional reference. Any content entered by the user is stored locally on the
user’s device and is not transmitted to the developer unless the user explicitly chooses to
export or share it.
</p>

<h3>2. Camera and Media Access</h3>
<p>
The App may request access to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Camera – to capture clinical reference images (such as wound or skin documentation)</li>
  <li>Photo library / device storage – to save or retrieve assessment-related images</li>
</ul>
<p>
The App does not access the camera or photo library without explicit user action.
</p>

<h3>3. Analytics and Usage Data</h3>
<p>
To improve app stability, performance, and usability, the App may collect limited, non-identifying
analytics data, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>App usage events</li>
  <li>Operating system and app version</li>
  <li>Device type</li>
  <li>Approximate city-level location (derived from IP address, not GPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Analytics collection is optional and may be enabled or disabled by the user. Analytics data does
not include assessment content, notes, images, or other clinical documentation.
</p>

<h3>4. Purchases</h3>
<p>
The App offers optional in-app purchases to unlock additional features.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchases are processed by the platform provider (Google Play Store or Apple App Store)</li>
  <li>The App does not receive or store payment card information</li>
  <li>Purchase validation is handled through a third-party service used solely for entitlement
  management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No precise location data (GPS)</li>
  <li>No contacts</li>
  <li>No background audio or video recording</li>
  <li>No biometric identifiers</li>
  <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
  <li>No personal identifiers beyond information the user voluntarily enters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Use</h2>
<p>
Collected information is used only to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and maintain app functionality</li>
  <li>Improve stability and user experience</li>
  <li>Enable optional feature unlocks</li>
  <li>Diagnose errors and crashes</li>
</ul>
<p>
Data is never sold and is not used for advertising purposes.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
User-entered content is intended to remain stored locally on the user’s device. The App uses
reasonable technical measures to protect locally stored data. Clinical documentation is not
transmitted to the developer unless the user explicitly chooses to export or share it.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal
information from children.
</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may deny camera or media permissions; some features may not function</li>
  <li>You may enable or disable analytics at any time</li>
  <li>You may uninstall the App at any time to stop all data collection</li>
  <li>You may manage in-app purchases through your platform’s account settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected by the “Last
updated” date above.

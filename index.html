<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Privacy Policy – My RN Assistant
Last updated: January 2026
My RN Assistant (“the App”) is a free clinical assessment application designed for nursing
students and individual registered nurses. This Privacy Policy explains what information is
collected, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.

Information We Collect
1. Information You Provide
● Patient assessment data, notes, and clinical inputs entered by the user
● Media captured by the user (photos or audio) when using app features

This data is stored locally on the device and is intended solely for the user’s educational or
professional use.

2. Camera and Media Access
The App requests access to:
● Camera – to document assessments or wounds
● Photo library / storage – to save or retrieve assessment-related media

The App does not access the camera or media library without explicit user action.

3. Analytics and Usage Data
To improve app stability, performance, and usability, the App collects limited, non-identifying
analytics data, including:

● App usage events
● Operating system and app version
● Device type
● Approximate city-level location (derived from IP, not GPS)

Analytics data is collected using a third-party analytics service and is used only to understand
how the App is used and to improve functionality.

4. Purchases
The App offers optional in-app purchases to unlock additional features.
● Purchases are processed by the platform provider (Google Play Store or Apple App
Store)
● The App does not receive or store payment card details
● Purchase validation is handled through a third-party service

Information We Do Not Collect
● No precise location (GPS)
● No contacts
● No background audio or video
● No biometric identifiers
● No advertising identifiers
● No personal identifiers beyond what the user voluntarily enters

Data Use
Collected information is used to:
● Provide and maintain app functionality
● Improve stability and user experience
● Enable optional feature unlocks
● Diagnose errors and crashes

Data is never sold or used for advertising purposes.

Data Storage and Security
The App uses reasonable technical measures to protect stored data. Sensitive clinical
information is intended to remain on the user’s device unless the user explicitly exports or
shares it.

Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal
information from children.

Your Choices
● You may deny camera or media permissions; some features may not function
● You may uninstall the App at any time to stop all data collection
● You may manage in-app purchases through your platform’s account settings

Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected by the “Last
updated” date above.

Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the app developer through the
app’s official distribution page.
